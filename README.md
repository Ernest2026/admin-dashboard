Template:
---------

<a href="https://github.com/____" target="_blank" title="____">
  <img src="https://github.com/____.png?size=40" height="40" width="40" alt="____" />
</a>

Instructions:
-------------

1. Copy the template and paste it below.
2. Replace the four "____" strings with the contributor's GitHub username.

Note: I specified the avatars using HTML because, when I did so using Markdown,
      only the _custom_ avatars appeared at the size I specified via the URL
      (e.g. 40px squared, for `https://github.com/gitname.png?size=40`);
      the GitHub-generated avatars seemed to ignore the size parameter and,
      instead, appear at their full size (approximately 420px squared).
      By using HTML, I can force _both_ types to appear at 40px squared.
